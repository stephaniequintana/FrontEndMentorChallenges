## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements - in the case of this challenge, the only interactive state is the cursor should change to a pointer when hovered over the "button."

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important thing I learned is to not stop learning!! I attempted this challenge months ago and had a very difficult time and after much study and coding of other projects I decided to return to Front End Mentor... I'm so glad I did. 

Although this design can be improved, I am now able to articulate how and why. A concrete take-away is that I learned:
 - how to implement transform/translate to center an element. In this challenge particularly, implementing it into a media query.

```css
.centering-elements {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```


### Continued development

I'm excited to return to Front End Mentor and am hoping I can complete many more challenges and meet some interesting Developers along the way. I am continuing my learning journey through multiple outlets and look forward to when the "impossible" seem like near-second-hand knowledge!
